##Tech Description

Since I am using bower to manage all project depencies including bootstrap, so iot6s very easy to upgrade any package and manage everything including mamnaging different versions of jQuery compatibl with respective versions of boostrap. Also I can manage any git ende point to use as a package manager. 

Bower website: http://bower.io/

Some example bower use cases are

# registered package (I use this for bootstrap and pakcaged jQuery, which can also be managed as seperate package)
$ bower install bootstrap 

# GitHub shorthand
$ bower install desandro/masonry

# Git endpoint 
$ bower install git://github.com/user/package.git

# I have used the follwing packages from github (commands)

$ bower install git://github.com/jssor/jquery-slider.git
$ bower install --save fontawesome

# Their demos site is http://jssor.com/

# URL
$ bower install http://example.com/script.js

##Note: 

Question: A possible question that why I am checking in the bower_components and not the node modules?

Short Answer: Because I am customising the bootstrap via less files and adding depencies to it. Since I am not making any changes to node modules, I don't need them in my repo.

##Customisation of bootstrap

This web page uses twitter bootstrap. You need to have node and grunt installed f0r any bootstrap related modification.

#Installing Grunt

To install Grunt, you must first download and install node.js (which includes npm). npm stands for node packaged modules and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js.

Then, from the command line:

1. Install grunt-cli globally with npm install -g grunt-cli.
2. Navigate to the root /bootstrap/ directory, then run npm install. npm will look at the package.json file and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

Available Grunt commands
grunt dist (Just compile CSS and JavaScript)
Regenerates the /dist/ directory with compiled and minified CSS and JavaScript files. As a Bootstrap user, this is normally the command you want.

grunt watch (Watch)
Watches the Less source files and automatically recompiles them to CSS whenever you save a change.

grunt test (Run tests)
Runs JSHint and runs the QUnit tests headlessly in PhantomJS.

grunt (Build absolutely everything and run tests)
Compiles and minifies CSS and JavaScript, builds the documentation website, runs the HTML5 validator against the docs, regenerates the Customizer assets, and more. Usually only necessary if you're hacking on Bootstrap itself.

Troubleshooting
Should you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running Grunt commands, first delete the /node_modules/ directory generated by npm. Then, rerun npm install.

## Customisation 

Since bootstrap has a very detailed 'less' file structure, it was pretty easy for me to add and edit things and get them compiled via Grunt tasks. I used other bower compnents to be compiled into bootstrap to keep the number of webpage resources to minimum which helps with performance of the website.
